PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) and CPM (Critical Path Method) are
project management tools used to plan, schedule, and manage complex projects. They both help
project managers in organizing and completing tasks efficiently, but they have distinct
characteristics:

PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique):

● Probabilistic Approach: PERT takes a probabilistic approach to project scheduling. It
considers three time estimates for each task: optimistic (O), most likely (M), and pessimistic
(P). These estimates are used to calculate an expected duration for each task.

● Activity Network: PERT represents a project as a network diagram with nodes (events) and
arrows (activities). Activities are connected by nodes, and the sequence of activities
determines the project's flow.

● Critical Path: PERT identifies the critical path in the project network, which is the longest
sequence of dependent activities that determines the minimum project duration. Tasks on the
critical path have no slack or float.

● Uncertainty Management: PERT is particularly useful for projects with a high degree of
uncertainty or where task durations can vary significantly. It allows project managers to
assess the probability of meeting project deadlines.

● Used in Complex Projects: PERT is commonly used in research and development projects,
construction projects, and any project where task durations are uncertain.

CPM (Critical Path Method):

● Deterministic Approach: CPM employs a deterministic approach to project scheduling. It
assumes fixed, known durations for each task. There are no probabilistic time estimates in
CPM.

● Activity Network: Like PERT, CPM represents a project using a network diagram with nodes
(events) and arrows (activities). Activities are linked sequentially.

● Critical Path: CPM also identifies the critical path, which is the longest sequence of
dependent activities determining the shortest project duration. Tasks on the critical path have
no slack or float.

● Focused on Time: CPM is mainly used to calculate the minimum time required to complete a project. It's suitable for projects where task durations are relatively certain.

● Used in Construction and Manufacturing: CPM is often applied in construction, manufacturing, and other industries where task durations can be reliably estimated.

In summary, PERT and CPM are both valuable project management techniques, but they are chosen based on the nature of the project. PERT is favored when there is uncertainty in task
durations and a need to consider probabilistic estimates, while CPM is preferred for projects with well-defined and deterministic task durations. Both methods help project managers plan and control projects to meet their objectives and deadlines efficiently.

Differences between PERT and CPM

PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) and CPM (Critical Path Method) are both project management techniques used to plan and manage projects. While they share similarities, they also have several key differences:

Nature of Time Estimates: PERT uses probabilistic time estimates for each task. It considers three
time estimates for each task: Optimistic (O), Most likely (M), and Pessimistic (P). These
estimates are used to calculate an expected duration, taking into account the uncertainty of task
durations. CPM on the other hand uses deterministic time estimates, assuming that task durations
are fixed and known with certainty. There is no consideration of probabilistic time estimates in
CPM.

Activity Duration Calculation:
PERT: PERT calculates the expected duration of each task using a weighted average of the three
time estimates (O, M, and P). The formula is: Expected Duration = (O + 4M + P) / 6.
CPM: CPM uses a single, fixed duration for each task, as there are no probabilistic estimates
involved. Task durations in CPM are based on historical data or expert judgment.

Critical Path: PERT identifies the critical path, which is the longest path through the project
network. The critical path may vary based on the probabilistic estimates, as it considers the
expected duration of each task. CPM also identifies the critical path, which is the longest path
through the project network. However, in CPM, the critical path is determined solely by the fixed
task durations and does not account for variability.


Focus on Uncertainty: PERT is particularly useful for projects with high uncertainty or where
task durations can vary significantly. It provides a way to assess the probability of meeting
project deadlines. CPM on the other hand is suited for projects where task durations are
relatively certain and deterministic. It focuses on finding the minimum time required to complete
the project.
Application Areas:
PERT: PERT is commonly used in research and development projects, construction projects, and
any project where task durations are uncertain and need probabilistic analysis.

CPM: CPM is often applied in construction, manufacturing, and other industries where task
durations can be reliably estimated and where the primary concern is minimizing project
duration.
Calculating Total Project Duration:
PERT: The total project duration in PERT is calculated as the sum of the expected durations
along the critical path.
CPM: In CPM, the total project duration is simply the sum of the fixed task durations along the
critical path.
In summary, PERT and CPM are both project management techniques used to plan and manage
projects, but they differ in their approach to time estimates and their suitability for different types
of projects. PERT is more appropriate for projects with uncertain task durations, while CPM is
better suited for projects with deterministic task durations
